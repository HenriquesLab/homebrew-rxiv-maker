# Introduction

This is a test manuscript designed to validate the functionality of rxiv-maker when installed through Homebrew. The document contains basic formatting elements to ensure the LaTeX conversion process works correctly.

## Background

rxiv-maker is an automated LaTeX article generation system that converts Markdown manuscripts into publication-ready PDFs. This test document validates that the core functionality works after installation via Homebrew package manager.

### Key Features Being Tested

1. **Markdown to LaTeX conversion**: Basic text formatting and structure
2. **Bibliography processing**: Reference management and citation formatting  
3. **PDF generation**: Complete document compilation
4. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across operating systems

## Methods

This test manuscript uses minimal content to reduce processing time while still exercising the core functionality:

- **Text formatting**: Bold, italic, and `code` formatting
- **Lists**: Both numbered and bulleted lists
- **Sections**: Hierarchical document structure
- **Citations**: Basic reference handling [@testcitation2025]
- **Mathematical expressions**: Simple inline math $E = mc^2$

### Test Environment

The validation process runs in GitHub Actions with the following matrix:

- **macOS**: Latest and macOS-12 versions
- **Linux**: Ubuntu latest and 20.04 LTS versions
- **Installation method**: Homebrew package manager
- **Dependencies**: All required system packages installed automatically

## Results

If this PDF is successfully generated, it indicates that:

✓ **Homebrew installation**: rxiv-maker installed correctly  
✓ **CLI functionality**: Command-line interface working  
✓ **Manuscript processing**: Markdown parsing successful  
✓ **PDF generation**: LaTeX compilation completed  
✓ **Cross-platform**: Build system works on target OS  

## Discussion

The successful generation of this test manuscript demonstrates that rxiv-maker's core functionality is working correctly after Homebrew installation. This validates:

### Installation Process

The Homebrew formula correctly:
- Installs rxiv-maker via pipx in an isolated environment
- Sets up all required dependencies (Python, Node.js, LaTeX)
- Makes the `rxiv` command available in the system PATH
- Maintains proper isolation from system Python packages

### Build System

The rxiv-maker build system successfully:
- Parses the YAML configuration file
- Converts Markdown content to LaTeX
- Processes bibliographic references
- Compiles the final PDF document

## Conclusion

This test manuscript serves as a lightweight validation tool for rxiv-maker Homebrew installations. Its successful compilation indicates that the installation process completed correctly and the software is ready for scientific manuscript preparation.
